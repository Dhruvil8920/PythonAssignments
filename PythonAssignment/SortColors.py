"""
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place
so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
Here, we use integers to represent the colors: 0 for red, 1 for white, and 2 for blue.

The task is to sort the array in linear time and in-place (without using extra space) using the Dutch National Flag algorithm.

Example:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Explanation:

The input array nums represents objects of different colors: 0 for red, 1 for white, and 2 for blue.
